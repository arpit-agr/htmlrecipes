{% set description %}
It is common for articles to start with a heading. In this context, the `<header>` element is ideal for introductory content like a heading or table of contents.

Articles often include metadata like the publication date, author information or a list of tags. This kind of information is well-suited for the `<footer>` element. As per <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-footer-element">the HTML Standard</a>: <q>A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.</q> While footers are usually displayed at the end, they donâ€™t necessarily have to be. What matters is the semantic meaning, not the visual position.

If the author's contact information, like an email, website or social handle, is included, the `<address>` element is appropriate. If no actual contact information is provided, a simple `<p>` element is more suitable. As the HTML Standard notes: <q>Contact information for the author or editor of a section belongs in an address element, possibly itself inside a footer.</q>
